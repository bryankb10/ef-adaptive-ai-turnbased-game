Turn-based combat games rely heavily on artificial intelligence (AI) to provide engaging, strategic, and unpredictable opponents. However, traditional rule-based approaches often result in deterministic behaviours that reduce player immersion and replayability. This project presents the implementation of an AI controlled Hero designed to compete against a player-controlled Boss within a turn-based combat game environment. The system integrates a utility-based scoring model enhanced with probabilistic techniques, including conditional probability and frequency analysis, to support adaptive and non-deterministic decision making.

The game is developed using the Unity Engine with C# handling the core game logic and user interaction, while Python is utilized for AI computation and decision evaluation. The AI evaluates available actions, such as attacking, healing, and executing counter skills by dynamically assigning utility scores based on the current game state, status effects, and observed player behaviour. A finite state machine (FSM) governs the Boss character across multiple combat phases, introducing increasing complexity and requiring the AI to adapt strategically throughout the encounter.

Experimental testing demonstrates that the proposed AI system successfully reduces predictability while maintaining stable performance and low decision latency. Results indicate improved adaptability and more varied gameplay responses compared to static rule-based approaches. This project highlights the effectiveness of combining utility-based AI with probabilistic reasoning in turn-based combat systems and provides a scalable framework for developing intelligent and engaging non-player characters in role playing games.

To run the game, you can download the zip file and open Eternal Fantasy.exe, and enjoy the game :). If you dont understand the gameplay, you can check the tutorial in the main menu. We will upload the training dataset, training model, and several important scripts in the forseeable future.
